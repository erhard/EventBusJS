# EventBusJS
EventBus for Javascript. mainly used in my new VUE3 projects

It replaces the code from VUE2 :

import Vue from "vue";
const EventBus = new Vue();
export default EventBus;

But in VUE3 there is not that possibility anymore

This eventbus is pure there are no other lib during runtime.
So You can use it framework independent.




##Installation
npm install eventbusjs

##Usage 
import EventBus from 'vjseventbus';
